It is designed to fit the Sword of Eomer (UC3383). It features a solid metal chape, collar, and locket with horse heads, all finished with an antique brass-plating. The wood core is wrapped in durable PVC leather to match the look of the prop. Close attention to detail was a top priority. All officially-licensed replicas feature the film copyright notice clearly marked on the product along with a certificate to verify its authenticity.\n\n#unboxing #lordoftherings #eomer",
